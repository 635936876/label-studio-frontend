/* Unforunately LS only supports SASS 
* which isn't easily convertible to less.
* There is way to do so based on this article:
* https://dev.to/agmm/simple-way-of-modifying-ant-design-default-theme-3g4h
* STEPS:
* mv theme.less overview/label-studio-frontend/node_modules/antd/dist
* cd overview/label-studio-frontend/node_modules/antd/dist
* npx lessc --js my-theme.less antd-override.css 
* copy antd-override.css back to this directory.
